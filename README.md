# ColourExpert - DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this software is to let the user play a game in which they determine which image (generated by the program) has the most amount of a certain color.
For example: The program shows two images on the screen, both with randomized colored shapes. The program prompts the user to pick which picture has more blue.

Because the program is creating each of the pictures, it will also keep track of the RGB properties. Depending on the range of the RGB values, the program
will determine if it has more red, green, or blue. There will be an algorithm to also determine other colors, such as orange, yellow, purple, etc.
The player can choose how many rounds they want to do. At the end, depending on how many they got correct, the program's point system will keep track of
how many rounds they succeeded.

Why would anyone want to use this software over existing ones? Because, as the creator of this program, I have not seen anything like this yet. I have come across
programs that do similar things, but not exactly like how I am creating it.
